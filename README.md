Exercises using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib – UBA's Computational Thinking Guide 6

# Python Libraries Exercises  
University of Buenos Aires – Introduction to Computational Thinking

This repository contains my solutions for Guide 6 from the course *Introduction to Computational Thinking* at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA).

## Topics Covered

- Array creation and manipulation with NumPy
- DataFrames and data analysis with Pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Statistical operations and plotting
- Practice with structured, modular logic

All exercises are documented with the original instructions as comments inside the `GUIA6.py` file.

## Personal Note

As part of my journey in Computer Engineering, this project focuses on practicing essential Python libraries used in data analysis and scientific computing.  
I'll continue expanding with real-world data and problem-solving challenges to improve my technical foundation.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the file `GUIA6.py`.
2. Install the required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.
3. Open the file in a Python-compatible editor (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Notebook).
4. Explore each section (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) independently.
